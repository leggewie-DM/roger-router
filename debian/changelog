roger-router (1.8.9-3) experimental; urgency=medium

  * release to experimental while jessie is frozen
  * do not build the experimental (!) cups backend. Closes: #774116
    Upstream uses a very funny (NOT!) semantics to their make-switches.
    Who would expect that "--with-cups=yes" actually DISABLES a working
    cups support?
    Personally, I was unable to verify this fix but Dieter Sch√§fer
    kindly provided confirmation that the test packages I had provided
    are now working fine for sending faxes. Thanks!
  * control: drop unused substvar from ffgtk transitional package stanza
  * rules: stop shipping install-fax.sh file. Closes: #772402
  * README.Debian: add some information on how to send a fax

roger-router (1.8.9-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * copyright: add copyright information for win32/printer/ghostpdf.ppd
  * rules: don't abort compilation on deprecated declarations
    GTK3 3.14 deprecated a number of functions which resulted in FTBFS
    after October 10.  These issues will need to be addressed with upstream
